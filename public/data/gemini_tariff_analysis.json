On August 6, 2025, Trump doubled the tariff to 50% (an additional 25%) as punishment for India's continued purchase of Russian oil, which Trump said enables Russia's war machine in Ukraine. The 50% tariff rate took effect on August 27, 2025, making it one of the highest tariffs the U.S. charges on any trading partner. India strongly criticized the tariffs as 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable' and vowed to protect its national interests.",

The volume of de minimis shipments had exploded from 134 million in 2015 to over 1.36 billion in 2024.
