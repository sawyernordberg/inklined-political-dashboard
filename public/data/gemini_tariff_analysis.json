On August 6, 2025, Trump doubled the tariff to 50% (an additional 25%) as punishment for India's continued purchase of Russian oil, which Trump said enables Russia's war machine in Ukraine. The 50% tariff rate took effect on August 27, 2025, making it one of the highest tariffs the U.S. charges on any trading partner. India strongly criticized the tariffs as 'unfair, unjustified and unreasonable' and vowed to protect its national interests.",

This followed the earlier suspension for China and Hong Kong on May 2, 2025. The move closes what Trump called a \"catastrophic loophole\" used to avoid tariffs and import unsafe products, including fentanyl. The volume of de minimis shipments had exploded from 134 million in 2015 to over 1.36 billion in 2024.
